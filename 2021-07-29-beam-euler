# First step:

First step in our code is import all libraries we need. In this code three libraries are required: *numpy* to compute the beam stiffness matrices, load and displacement vectors, respectively, *numpy mask* to set the boundary conditions of our problem and *matplotlib* to plot our result, a.k.a post-processing. In order to import these libraries we write the following commands

# Second step:

# Third step:

# Fourth step:
